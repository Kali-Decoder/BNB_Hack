# Stream

Stream is a pioneering decentralized social network built on the BNB Chain ecosystem, designed to transform the way we connect, share, and monetize content. Our platform integrates the robust capabilities of BNB Greenfield for decentralized storage, ensuring data sovereignty and privacy for all users. Stream addresses critical issues in traditional social networks, such as data ownership, censorship, and intermediaries, by leveraging BNB Chain to create a secure, transparent, and user-centric environment.
